# Understanding JS Destructuring

Through your recent React lessons you have seen many `import` statements at the top of your files that use object destructuring. For example:

```js
import { Component } from 'react'
```

You have also learned about destructing objects [from this lesson a few weeks back in learn.co](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/fewpjs_destructuring_assignment).

The following blog post explores many ways to use this ES6 convention, including the spread syntax and rest parameters. Open up a JS console and explore the examples as you follow along with the article. You will encounter many styles of Javascript as you continue your journey into software development. As you review these examples, remind yourself that this is just simple Javascript and **not** something special you get from the React library.
