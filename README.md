# Understanding JS Destructuring

In your recent React lessons you have seen `import` statements at the top of your files that use object destructuring. For example:

```js
import { Component } from 'react'
```

You have also learned about destructing objects before, [from this previous lesson in learn.co](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/fewpjs_destructuring_assignment).

The following article explores more to use this ES6 convention, including the spread syntax and rest parameters. Open up a JS console and explore the examples as you follow along with the post. You will encounter many styles of Javascript as you continue your journey into software development. As you review these examples, remind yourself that these are just simple Javascript and **not** something special you get from React.
